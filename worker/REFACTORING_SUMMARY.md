# Worker Refactoring Summary

## What Was Changed

Successfully refactored the VeriFrame worker from blockchain-based polling to API-based workflow.

### Files Created

1. **`worker/src/main_api.py`** (640 lines)
   - New API-based worker implementation
   - Replaces direct blockchain access with backend API calls
   - Preserves all rendering logic from original worker

2. **`worker/.env.example`**
   - Template for environment configuration
   - Includes new variables for backend API and authentication

3. **`worker/README_API.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation of new architecture
   - API endpoints reference
   - Migration guide from old worker
   - Troubleshooting section

## Key Changes

### Architecture Shift

**Before (main.py)**:
```
Worker â†’ StarkNet RPC â†’ Job Registry Contract
Worker â†’ Check jobs on-chain
Worker â†’ Submit results via blockchain transaction
```

**After (main_api.py)**:
```
Worker â†’ Backend API â†’ Database + Blockchain
Worker â†’ Authenticate with JWT
Worker â†’ GET /api/v1/jobs/available
Worker â†’ POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/assign
Worker â†’ POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/complete
```

### New Components

#### 1. WorkerAuthenticator Class
```python
class WorkerAuthenticator:
    - authenticate() - Get JWT token from backend
    - _sign_challenge() - Sign auth challenge
    - get_headers() - Return auth headers
    - ensure_authenticated() - Auto-refresh token
```

#### 2. API Functions
```python
- poll_available_jobs() - GET /api/v1/jobs/available
- claim_job() - POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/assign
- submit_job_completion() - POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/complete
```

#### 3. Preserved Functions
All rendering logic was kept intact:
- `IPFSClient` - IPFS operations with HTTP fallback
- `download_blend_file()` - Download and extract .blend from IPFS
- `validate_blend_file()` - Validate Blender can open file
- `render_blend_file()` - Execute Blender rendering
- `upload_render_result()` - Upload result to IPFS
- `process_render_job()` - Complete job pipeline

### Environment Variables

New variables added:
```bash
BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
WORKER_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
WORKER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
POLL_INTERVAL=10
```

Removed (no longer needed):
```bash
STARKNET_RPC
JOB_REGISTRY_ADDRESS
```

### Main Loop Comparison

**Old Flow**:
```python
1. Connect to StarkNet RPC
2. Create contract instance
3. while True:
   - check_for_jobs(contract)
   - download, render, upload
   - submit_result(contract, job_id, result_cid)
```

**New Flow**:
```python
1. Authenticate with backend API
2. Initialize IPFS client
3. while True:
   - poll_available_jobs(auth)
   - claim_job(auth, job_id)
   - download, render, upload
   - submit_job_completion(auth, job_id, result_cid)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Blockchain Load
- Backend batches transactions
- Worker doesn't need to maintain RPC connection
- Lower gas costs from optimized contract calls

### 2. Better Error Handling
- API returns structured error messages
- JWT expiry handled automatically
- Failed jobs don't require blockchain cleanup

### 3. Centralized State Management
- Backend tracks job states in database
- Consistent view across all workers
- Prevents race conditions on job claiming

### 4. Improved Security
- Worker authentication with challenge/signature
- JWT tokens with expiry
- Backend validates worker eligibility

### 5. Easier Monitoring
- Backend can track worker health
- API logs all worker actions
- Performance metrics collection

## Testing Checklist

To test the new worker:

- [ ] Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
- [ ] Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- [ ] Verify IPFS node is accessible
- [ ] Check Blender is installed: `blender --version`
- [ ] Run worker: `python src/main_api.py`
- [ ] Create a job in frontend
- [ ] Watch worker logs for job pickup
- [ ] Verify job completion in frontend
- [ ] Check IPFS for uploaded result

## Migration Path

### For Development
1. Keep old worker as backup
2. Run new worker with `python src/main_api.py`
3. Monitor for issues
4. Switch fully once validated

### For Production
1. Deploy backend API first
2. Test API endpoints manually
3. Deploy new worker to staging
4. Run both workers in parallel briefly
5. Deprecate old worker once stable

## Backwards Compatibility

- Old worker (`main.py`) still works unchanged
- Both can run simultaneously
- No changes required to existing jobs
- Frontend works with both approaches

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Real StarkNet signature implementation
2. WebSocket connection for real-time job notifications
3. Parallel job processing (multiple Blender instances)
4. Progress reporting during rendering
5. Worker health metrics endpoint
6. Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

## Files Unchanged

These files were not modified:
- `worker/requirements.txt` - No new dependencies needed
- `worker/dockerfile` - Works with both versions
- `worker/src/main.py` - Original worker preserved

## Command Reference

### Run New Worker
```bash
cd worker
python src/main_api.py
```

### Run Old Worker (deprecated)
```bash
cd worker
python src/main.py
```

### Test Backend API
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Get available jobs (needs auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/available
```

### Test IPFS
```bash
# Check IPFS node
ipfs id

# Test file download
ipfs get <CID>
```

### Test Blender
```bash
# Check version
blender --version

# Test headless render
blender -b scene.blend -f 1
```

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can I still use the old worker?
**A:** Yes, `main.py` is unchanged and fully functional.

### Q: Do I need to change anything in the frontend?
**A:** No, frontend uses the backend API, which works with both worker versions.

### Q: What if authentication fails?
**A:** Worker will log error and exit. Check `WORKER_ADDRESS` and backend logs.

### Q: How do I know if a job is processing?
**A:** Check worker logs for "Successfully claimed job {id}" message.

### Q: Can multiple workers run simultaneously?
**A:** Yes, backend handles job assignment to prevent conflicts.

### Q: Is this faster than the old worker?
**A:** Slightly faster polling, same rendering time. Main benefit is reliability.
