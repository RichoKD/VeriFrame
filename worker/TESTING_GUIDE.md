# Worker Testing Guide

Complete testing strategy for the API-based worker.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Backend running
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 2. IPFS daemon running
ipfs daemon

# 3. Frontend running (optional, for visual testing)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Test Data Preparation

Create a simple test `.blend` file:
```python
# save as create_test_blend.py
import bpy

# Clear default scene
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Add a simple cube
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(location=(0, 0, 0))

# Add a camera
bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(7, -7, 5))
bpy.context.scene.camera = bpy.context.object

# Add a light
bpy.ops.object.light_add(type='SUN', location=(5, 5, 5))

# Save
bpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath='test_scene.blend')
print("Created test_scene.blend")
```

Run it:
```bash
blender --background --python create_test_blend.py
```

Upload to IPFS:
```bash
ipfs add test_scene.blend
# Note the CID: QmXyz...
```

## Unit Tests

### Test 1: Worker Authentication

**Purpose**: Verify worker can authenticate with backend

**Test Code**:
```python
import asyncio
from src.main_api import WorkerAuthenticator

async def test_auth():
    auth = WorkerAuthenticator(
        backend_url="http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
        worker_address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
        private_key=""
    )
    
    success = await auth.authenticate()
    assert success, "Authentication should succeed"
    assert auth.token is not None, "Token should be set"
    print(f"‚úÖ Authentication successful: {auth.token[:20]}...")

asyncio.run(test_auth())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Requesting auth challenge for 0x1234...
[Worker] Submitting signed challenge
[Worker] Successfully authenticated. Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
‚úÖ Authentication successful: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

### Test 2: IPFS Client

**Purpose**: Verify IPFS download/upload works

**Test Code**:
```python
import tempfile
import os
from src.main_api import IPFSClient

def test_ipfs():
    ipfs = IPFSClient("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001")
    
    # Test upload
    test_file = "test.txt"
    with open(test_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("Hello, VeriFrame!")
    
    result = ipfs.add(test_file)
    cid = result["Hash"]
    print(f"‚úÖ Uploaded file, CID: {cid}")
    
    # Test download
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        ipfs.get(cid, temp_dir)
        downloaded = os.path.join(temp_dir, cid)
        assert os.path.exists(downloaded), "File should be downloaded"
        print(f"‚úÖ Downloaded file to: {downloaded}")
    
    os.remove(test_file)

test_ipfs()
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Connected to IPFS using ipfshttpclient
‚úÖ Uploaded file, CID: QmXyz...
[Worker] Downloading CID: QmXyz... via IPFS API
‚úÖ Downloaded file to: /tmp/tmpxyz/QmXyz...
```

### Test 3: Blend File Validation

**Purpose**: Verify Blender can open files

**Test Code**:
```python
import asyncio
from src.main_api import validate_blend_file

async def test_validation():
    # Test valid file
    valid = await validate_blend_file("test_scene.blend")
    assert valid, "Valid blend file should pass"
    print("‚úÖ Valid blend file validated")
    
    # Test invalid file
    with open("invalid.blend", 'w') as f:
        f.write("not a blend file")
    
    invalid = await validate_blend_file("invalid.blend")
    assert not invalid, "Invalid blend file should fail"
    print("‚úÖ Invalid blend file rejected")
    
    os.remove("invalid.blend")

asyncio.run(test_validation())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Validating blend file: test_scene.blend
[Worker] Blend file validation successful
‚úÖ Valid blend file validated
[Worker] Validating blend file: invalid.blend
[Worker] Blend file validation failed
‚úÖ Invalid blend file rejected
```

### Test 4: Rendering

**Purpose**: Verify Blender can render

**Test Code**:
```python
import asyncio
import tempfile
from src.main_api import render_blend_file

async def test_render():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        result = await render_blend_file("test_scene.blend", temp_dir)
        
        assert result is not None, "Render should succeed"
        assert os.path.exists(result), "Rendered file should exist"
        print(f"‚úÖ Render successful: {result}")

asyncio.run(test_render())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Rendering blend file to: /tmp/tmpxyz/render.png
[Worker] Executing: blender -b test_scene.blend -E BLENDER_EEVEE ...
[Worker] Render successful: /tmp/tmpxyz/render0001.png
‚úÖ Render successful: /tmp/tmpxyz/render0001.png
```

## Integration Tests

### Test 5: API Job Polling

**Purpose**: Verify worker can poll for jobs

    auth = WorkerAuthenticator(
        backend_url="http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
        worker_address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
    )
    
    await auth.authenticate()
    jobs = await poll_available_jobs(auth)
    
    print(f"‚úÖ Found {len(jobs)} available jobs")
    for job in jobs:
        print(f"   - Job {job['id']}: {job.get('asset_cid', 'N/A')}")

asyncio.run(test_polling())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Requesting auth challenge...
[Worker] Successfully authenticated...
[Worker] Found 0 available jobs
‚úÖ Found 0 available jobs
```

### Test 6: Job Claiming

**Purpose**: Verify worker can claim a job

**Setup**: Create a job in the frontend first

**Test Code**:
```python
import asyncio
from src.main_api import WorkerAuthenticator, poll_available_jobs, claim_job

async def test_claim():
    auth = WorkerAuthenticator(
        backend_url="http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
        worker_address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
    )
    
    await auth.authenticate()
    jobs = await poll_available_jobs(auth)
    
    if not jobs:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  No jobs available to claim")
        return
    
    job_id = jobs[0]["id"]
    success = await claim_job(auth, job_id)
    
    assert success, "Job claim should succeed"
    print(f"‚úÖ Successfully claimed job {job_id}")

asyncio.run(test_claim())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[Worker] Successfully authenticated...
[Worker] Found 1 available jobs
[Worker] Successfully claimed job 1
‚úÖ Successfully claimed job 1
```

### Test 7: Full Job Processing

    WorkerAuthenticator, 
    IPFSClient,
    poll_available_jobs,
    claim_job,
    process_render_job,
    submit_job_completion
)

async def test_full_workflow():
    # Setup
    auth = WorkerAuthenticator(
        backend_url="http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
        worker_address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
    )
    ipfs = IPFSClient("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001")
    
    # Authenticate
    await auth.authenticate()
    print("‚úÖ Authenticated")
    
    # Poll for jobs
    jobs = await poll_available_jobs(auth)
    if not jobs:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  No jobs available")
        return
    
    job = jobs[0]
    job_id = job["id"]
    asset_cid = job.get("asset_cid", "")
    print(f"‚úÖ Found job {job_id}")
    
    # Claim job
    claimed = await claim_job(auth, job_id)
    assert claimed
    print(f"‚úÖ Claimed job {job_id}")
    
    # Process job
    result_cid = await process_render_job(ipfs, job_id, asset_cid)
    assert result_cid
    print(f"‚úÖ Processed job, result: {result_cid}")
    
    # Submit result
    submitted = await submit_job_completion(auth, job_id, result_cid)
    assert submitted
    print(f"‚úÖ Submitted result for job {job_id}")
    
    print(f"\nüéâ Full workflow completed successfully!")

    )
    success = await auth.authenticate()
    assert success

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_ipfs_upload():
    ipfs = IPFSClient("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001")
    # Create temp file
    import tempfile
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:
        f.write(b"test data")
        f.flush()
        result = ipfs.add(f.name)
        assert "Hash" in result

# Add more tests...
```

Run tests:
